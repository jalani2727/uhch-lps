                        making them lose trust, itâ€™s important to communicate in a way they can understand.

                        <br />
                        Consider a gentle approach. Let them know how their hearing loss is affecting friends and family
                        members and that you are concerned for their health. A great way to communicate to them could be
                        through a handwritten letter, which may be helpful if their hearing loss is more severe.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        To further support your loved one, an online hearing test could be a simple, low-pressure
                        solution to start the conversation or process of treatment. Another option could be scheduling
                        an appointment with a hearing professional.</p>

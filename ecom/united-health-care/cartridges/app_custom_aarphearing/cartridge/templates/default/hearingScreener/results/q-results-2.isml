            <p>To support your loved one and help them get the treatment they need without frustrating them or making them lose trust, itâ€™s important to communicate in a way they can understand.
            <br />
            Consider a gentle approach. Let them know how their hearing loss is affecting friends and family members and that you are concerned for their health. A great way to communicate to them could be through a handwritten letter, which may be helpful if their hearing loss is more severe.
            <br />
            To further support your loved one, an online hearing test could be a simple, low-pressure solution to start the conversation or process of treatment. Another option could be scheduling an appointment with a hearing professional.</p>
